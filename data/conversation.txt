Zohaib:
Hello guys, lets start the standup.

Ikram:
Yes, let's start it. On what things have you guys been working on?

Zohaib:
I been focusing on the new feature for the data analytics dashboard. It's almost ready for testing, just need to finalize few things.

Ikram:
That sounds good. I've been working on the bug fixes from the last sprint. There was some issues with the API integration, but I think it should be resolved by today.

Zohaib:
Great to hear! Once you are done with the bug fixes, let's have a quick call to go over them. Anything else on your plate?

Ikram:
Yeah, sure, we can do that. I also start looking into the new module we need to integrate for the next release. But I'm still gathering the requirement.

Zohaib:
Alright, sounds like a plan. Let me know if you need help with the requirements. Let's aim to wrap up these tasks by end of the day.

Ikram:
Will do! I'll keep you updated. Let's make sure to stay on track with our timelines.

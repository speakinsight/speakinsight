OK, let's start the stand-up meeting. I hope everyone is doing well today. I think we have a lot to cover, so let's get into it.

Ikram Ali
Yes, Zohaib. So, last week I was working on the new user interface for the dashboard, and I am have completed most of the design by yesterday. I had been facing some issues with the responsiveness, but I am resolving them as I go. I think it should be ready for testing by tomorrow.

Zohaib Munir
Thatâ€™s good to hear, Ikram. I remembered you mentioning that the API integration was going to be a challenge. How it was going with that?

Ikram Ali
Actually, Zohaib, the API integration turned out to be more complicated than we were initially thinking. I have been working closely with the backend team, but we are facing some unexpected errors. We were hoping to finish it by the end of the week, but it might take a little longer.
